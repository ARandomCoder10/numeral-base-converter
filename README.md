# Numeral Base Converter
A number conversion tool that is capable of converting numbers between all bases within 2-62 inclusive.

## Code Quality
Written while learning programming constructs and code standards, resulting in less polished code, but is fully functional.

## Status
- Development: started 2020 (age 12) - now completed
- Maintenance: started 2021 - ongoing minor improvements

## Post-Development Algorithm Optimisations
- Added full validation
- Preventing possible program redundancies e.g. barring inputs 0 and 1 because they keep the same representation in all bases 2-62
- Numbers in base 2 are separated into nibbles for readability
- Included capability for negative numbers and decimals
- Can convert one number to multiple base representations
- Displayed formal names for each numeral base in the output e.g. nonary for base 9
- Added superscript annotations for each numeral base

## Version Control Note
This repository includes early commits I made while I was learning how to integrate GitHub with my PyCharm application.
My commit structure and practices have since improved as I gain more confidence & experience using GitHub.
